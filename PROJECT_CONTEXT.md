# FormBridge Project Context

## Product Direction

FormBridge is a SaaS/CRM layer over Google Forms.

Core idea:
- User logs in.
- User connects Google account.
- User selects a Google Form.
- FormBridge turns that form into a workspace with requests/responses, analytics, AI assistant, notifications, and exports.

Current product direction:
- Not every form is the same.
- FormBridge uses scenario-based workspaces.
- A form can be used for admissions, HR, surveys, client requests, events, or universal processing.
- The base data model is shared, but UI, statuses, AI prompts, and quick actions should adapt to the selected scenario.

## Current Scenarios

Supported scenarios:
- universal
- admissions
- hr
- survey
- client_requests
- event

## Important UX Principles

- Official, minimal, practical style.
- Main color: #123b2f.
- Avoid emoji icons in UI.
- Use real SVG icons or icon components.
- Avoid "AI-looking" exaggerated UI.
- Prefer clean CRM/workspace layout.
- Header should stay simple:
  - logo
  - language switcher
  - account menu
- Main navigation should be through /forms.
- One form workspace should show only requests/responses for that form.
- A form is "ready/connected" only when delivery is actually ready.
- A created integration record with missing trigger/webhook test is only "setup in progress".
- Setup-in-progress forms must show "continue setup", not "open workspace".

## AI Direction

Old AI concept:
- Analyze one selected request.

New AI concept:
- AI assistant per form workspace.
- AI uses only data from the selected form.
- AI should answer questions like:
  - summarize this form
  - what needs attention
  - who should be contacted first
  - survey conclusions
  - best candidates
  - missing data
  - daily/weekly summary

Current main endpoint:
- POST /api/ai/form-chat

Model:
- OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07

## Current Deployment Direction

Production domain:
- https://formbridge.nlrk.online

Server app path:
- /var/www/formbridge

Server secrets should live outside the repo:
- /opt/formbridge-secrets/backend.env.production
- /opt/formbridge-secrets/frontend.env.production

Deploy script:
- scripts/deploy_formbridge_server.sh

Only server deploy script should remain in scripts.

Backend port on server:
- PORT=4001

Nginx proxies FormBridge to:
- 127.0.0.1:4001

Never store secrets inside Git.

## Recent Completed Work

Completed:
- Added scenario config backend.
- Added scenario fields to form integrations.
- Added form feedback model/API.
- Added workspace API.
- Added scenario selection UI.
- Added form-level AI chat.
- Removed old request-level AI UI/backend route.
- Updated OpenAI model name to gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07.
- Simplified server deploy script to use /opt/formbridge-secrets only.
- Removed old local deployment scripts from Git.

Recent commits:
- 891b922 Simplify server deploy secrets handling
- 474921c Add scenario workspaces and form AI chat
- 7c7e596 Polish login success toast

## Known Risks / Things To Check

- Server /opt/formbridge-secrets must contain correct production env files.
- Backend production env must use PORT=4001.
- Google OAuth production redirect URIs must be configured for:
  - https://formbridge.nlrk.online/api/auth/google/callback
  - https://formbridge.nlrk.online/api/google/oauth/callback
- AI chat currently uses recent form requests as context.
- Survey scenario still needs a more analytics-focused workspace.
- HR/admissions scenarios need better quick actions later.
- WhatsApp notifications exist as MVP but should later adapt to scenarios.
- Export should later support PDF/Word/Excel reports.

### Replace emoji icons with SVG components (2026-05-31)

Files changed:
- `frontend/src/shared/icons.jsx` — created; exports IconGrid, IconAcademic, IconUser, IconChart, IconMessage, IconCalendar, IconGlobe, IconBell, IconSpark, IconCheck, IconAlert, IconExport, IconChevronDown, IconFeedback, IconAccount
- `frontend/src/pages/RequestsPage.jsx` — imported 6 scenario icons; replaced emoji strings in SCENARIO_CARDS with Icon component refs; updated ScenarioSelectBanner render to `<card.Icon size={22} />`

Replaced emoji:
- ⊞ (universal) → IconGrid
- 🎓 (admissions) → IconAcademic
- 👤 (hr) → IconUser
- 📊 (survey) → IconChart
- 💬 (client_requests) → IconMessage
- 📅 (event) → IconCalendar

Notes:
- App.jsx already used @heroicons/react (already installed); no new deps added
- All icons use currentColor, inherit color from CSS colorClass
- ✓ in App.jsx toast is a text character, not emoji — left as-is
- Frontend build verified successfully after the icon replacement

### Fix AI chat — switch to Chat Completions API (2026-05-31)

Files changed:
- `backend/src/services/openaiService.js` — replaced `client.responses.create` with `client.chat.completions.create`; removed `reasoning`, `max_output_tokens`; fallback model changed to `"gpt-5-nano"`; empty response logs `[formChat] OpenAI returned empty chat completion` without logging prompt/data

### Flexible request date filter (2026-05-31)

Files changed:
- `frontend/src/pages/RequestsPage.jsx` — replaced `DATE_FILTERS = ["all","today","week"]` with 6 options `["all","today","yesterday","last7","last30","custom"]`; `isWithinDateRange` now accepts `(dateStr, range, from, to)` with yesterday/last7/last30/custom logic using startOfDay/endOfDay; added `dateFrom`/`dateTo` state; `filteredItems` memo updated to pass from/to; toolbar now shows `.toolbar-date-group` with conditional date inputs when custom is selected
- `frontend/src/shared/i18n.js` — added 6 new keys in kk/ru/en: `dateFilterYesterday`, `dateFilterLast7`, `dateFilterLast30`, `dateFilterCustom`, `dateFrom`, `dateTo`
- `frontend/src/shared/styles/global.css` — added `.toolbar-date-group`, `.toolbar-date-custom`, `.toolbar-date-input-label`, `.toolbar-date-sep`; updated toolbar grid last column to `minmax(180px, auto)`

How to test:
1. Open any form workspace `/forms/:formId/requests`
2. Click the date dropdown — 6 options should appear
3. Select "Yesterday" / "Last 7 days" / "Last 30 days" — table filters accordingly
4. Select "Custom range" — two date inputs (From / To) appear below the select
5. Enter a date range — table filters to only those dates
6. Clear both inputs with "All" selected — all rows shown

Build: `npm run build` ✓

- `stats.attention` computed in useMemo
- 4th ws-stat shows "Needs attention / Требуют внимания / Назар қажет" (for non-survey)
- Highlighted in amber (`ws-stat--attention`) when count > 0
- For survey: 4th stat stays as "Новые"

#### Part 3 — Survey insights panel
- Added `SurveyInsightsPanel` component: total/today/last7 stats + popular answers (from loaded items)
- Shown above toolbar when `scenario === "survey"` and items.length > 0
- Table count label: "Ответы/Responses" for survey

#### Part 4 — Admissions polish

3. See quick action buttons (Contacted / Documents needed / Accept / Reject)
4. Click a button → status updates, button becomes active/disabled
5. Switch to **survey** scenario → survey insights panel appears above table; quick actions hidden
6. Check **WhatsApp** block collapsed → shows "On" / "Off" pill

### Guided Google Forms setup modal (2026-05-31)

Files changed:
- `frontend/src/components/GuidedSetupModal.jsx` — new component; 3-step guided setup modal
- `frontend/src/pages/MyFormsPage.jsx` — imports modal; "Connect" button replaces "Add to FormBridge"; connected forms show "Open workspace" link; modal state passed with formId/formTitle/googleEmail
- `frontend/src/shared/i18n.js` — 44 new keys in kk/ru/en (connectForm, openWorkspace, connectGoogleForm, setupIntro, all step/instruction/screenshot keys)
- `frontend/src/shared/styles/global.css` — 480+ lines added for setup modal styles

#### Modal UX flow:
1. User clicks "Connect" on any unconnected Google Form
2. Modal opens → silently calls `POST /api/integrations/forms/setup-google` (creates integration + tries to create Google Sheet)
3. **Step 1** — if `sheetId` returned → "Sheet linked"; else shows "Open Google Form" + "Check again"
4. **Step 2** — unlocked when Step 1 is "found"; "Prepare setup" calls `POST /api/integrations/forms/:id/auto-setup` → returns `scriptUrl`; "Open Google setup" opens Apps Script with AccountChooser URL; locked state if Step 1 not done
5. **Step 3** — unlocked when Step 2 prepared/opened; "Verify connection" calls `POST /api/integrations/forms/:id/verify`; shows checklist cards (Sheet/AutoDelivery/Webhook/Test); shows "Connection ready" + "Open workspace" on success

#### What is real vs placeholder:
- **Real**: all 3 endpoints (`setup-google`, `auto-setup`, `verify`), account-aware AccountChooser URLs, step locking logic, integration state derivation
- **Placeholder**: 9 screenshot slots (dashed border, "Add screenshot later" text) — visually rendered but no actual images

#### Screenshot placeholders locations:
- Step 1 accordion: "Screenshot: Responses tab", "Screenshot: Link to Sheets button", "Screenshot: Create spreadsheet"
- Step 2 accordion: "Screenshot: select installFormBridge", "Screenshot: Run button", "Screenshot: Allow permissions"

#### How to test with a new Google account:
1. Log in to FormBridge, connect Google account via `/forms`
2. Click "Connect" on any form
3. Modal opens; it auto-calls `setup-google` — if Google Drive API works, Step 1 should show "Sheet linked" immediately
4. If Step 1 missing: open the Google Form, go to Responses → Link to Sheets → Create new spreadsheet, then "Check again"
5. Step 2: click "Prepare setup" — requires Google Apps Script API enabled; returns scriptUrl
6. Click "Open Google setup" → opens Apps Script with your Google account; run `installFormBridge`
7. Return to modal, click "Verify connection"

#### CSS classes added:
`.setup-modal-backdrop`, `.setup-modal`, `.setup-header`, `.setup-step`, `.setup-step-locked`, `.setup-step--done`, `.setup-status-pill`, `.pill-ok/missing/checking/locked`, `.setup-actions`, `.setup-btn-primary/secondary`, `.setup-accordion`, `.setup-screenshot-grid`, `.setup-screenshot-placeholder`, `.setup-check-grid`, `.setup-check-item`, `.setup-ready-banner`, `.setup-reason-list`

Build: `npm run build` ✓
No emoji found ✓
Commit: bd77f23

## Next Planned Tasks
